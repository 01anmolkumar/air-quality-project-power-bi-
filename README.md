The best dashboard explanation format:  
‚Ä¢ **Business problem**  
‚Ä¢ **Goal of the dashboard**  
‚Ä¢ **Walkthrough of key visuals**  
‚Ä¢ **Business impact & insights**

Example:  
‚Ä¢ **Business Problem**  
India faces a major challenge with air pollution, affecting millions of lives each year. Policymakers, citizens, and researchers need a centralized and intuitive way to view pollution patterns across cities and monitor trends over time.

Key questions such as:  
**Which cities are most polluted?**  
**What is the contribution of different pollutants?**  
**Is air quality improving or worsening over time?**  
‚Ä¶are difficult to answer without a dynamic visualization.

‚Ä¢ **Goal of the Dashboard**  
To deliver an interactive visual tool that:  
- Enables users to **explore air quality across Indian cities**.  
- Supports **government, environmental, and health decisions**.  
- Tracks **year-wise AQI improvements and hotspot identification**.  
- Raises **public awareness** about pollution intensity.

‚Ä¢ **Walkthrough of Key Visuals**  
- **Key KPIs (Top Row)**  
  Average pollutant levels shown:  
  - **CO: 2.25**  
  - **NO: 17.57**  
  - **SO‚ÇÇ: 14.53**  
  - **PM2.5: 67.45**

- **City Filter Panel**  
  An interactive dropdown slicer lets users filter all visuals by specific cities.

- **Top 5 Polluted Cities (North/Central India)**  
  Bar chart ranks **Ahmedabad (452 AQI)**, followed by **Delhi, Patna, Gurugram, and Lucknow**.

- **List of 5 Polluted Cities (South/Northeast India)**  
  Cities like **Ernakulam, Thiruvananthapuram, and Shillong** are shown with relatively moderate AQI.

- **Area-wise AQI Overview (Map)**  
  Interactive map with colored bubbles representing AQI levels across Indian regions.

- **AQI Trend Overview (Line Chart)**  
  Displays **declining AQI from 2015 to 2020** ‚Äì indicating potential improvement due to policy or awareness.

‚Ä¢ **Business Impact & Insights**  
- **Public Health Planning:** Helps identify cities requiring urgent intervention.  
- **Policy Evaluation:** Yearly trend tracking helps evaluate the success of air quality initiatives.  
- **Environmental Advocacy:** Provides a powerful tool for awareness and reporting.  
- **Research Utility:** Acts as a visual dataset for academic and environmental research.
